# FiddlerToJMeter

Building and deploying your extension
=====================================
1. Close Fiddler.
2. Make sure you target AnyCPU when building your extension.
3. Build your extension in Debug mode and copy the outputs, JmeterExporter.dll and JmeterExporter.pdb, to either %ProgramFiles%\Fiddler2\ImportExport\ (available to all users) or, %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Fiddler2\ImportExport\ (available only to the current user).  Deploying the debug version with the .pdb file ensures that any error generated by your extension will report the line numbers of the offending code.
4. Start Fiddler and capture some traffic.
